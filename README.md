ChatOps Vagrant Machine
=======================

This is a ChatOps virtual machine, , which utilizes [Slack](https://slack.com) as an adapter connecting/interacting with [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) and [StackStorm](https://stackstorm.com/).

You can use it to play around with [ChatOps](https://stackstorm.com/2015/06/24/ansible-chatops-get-started-%F0%9F%9A%80/). It is not meant for any production usage.
